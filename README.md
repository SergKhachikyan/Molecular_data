# 🧬 Molecular Data

**Molecular Data** is an educational project focused on analyzing molecular datasets using Python and machine learning tools. The goal is to predict specific molecular properties based on the provided data.

### 1. 📁 Project Structure
```
- train.csv                # Training dataset containing molecular features
- test.csv                 # Test dataset used for model evaluation
- sample_submission.csv    # Sample format for submission results
- requirements.txt         # List of required dependencies
- Untitled.ipynb           # Main notebook with data analysis & modeling
- .gitignore               # Excludes unnecessary files from Git tracking
```

### 2. 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SergKhachikyan/Molecular_data.git
cd Molecular_data/Molecular_Data

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # For Unix/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate        # For Windows

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

### 3. 🧠 Technologies Used
```
- Python 3.11
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
```

### 4. 📊 Usage
In the `Untitled.ipynb` notebook, the following steps are implemented:
```
- Load and explore the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Preprocess the data
- Train machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance
- Generate a submission file (sample_submission.csv)
```

### 5. 📌 Notes
- This project is for educational purposes only.
- The datasets are sourced from public resources and used strictly for learning.
